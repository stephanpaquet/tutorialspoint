# Node.js - First Application

A Node.js application consists of following three important parts −

- **Import required modules** − We use require directive to load a Node.js module.
- **Create server** − A server which will listen to client's request similar to Apache HTTP Server.
- **Read request and return response** − server created in earlier step will read HTTP request made by client which can be a browser or console and return the response.

A first HTTP server up and running which is responding all the HTTP requests at port 8081.

```bash
 node main.js
 ```
